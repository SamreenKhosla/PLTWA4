For activity 4, work in your table group to create a program based on a question of interest. Share your question and data source early with the class on the Unit 4 DataLab Teams SheetLinks to an external site.. General requirements are:

This open-ended activity requires you to develop a program on a topic that interests you.
As a class, spend a few minutes reviewing the requirements of the open-ended activity.

Requirements
 
* Formulate a question you would like to answer
* Identify a data set that will help determine the answer to your question
* Create a class to model one entry of the identified data set
* Write a program with a main method to read the data from the identified data set into
your program
* Utilize an array or ArrayList and the created class to store data that has been read
* Write code to process the data and determine an answer to the identified question
* Graphically display your data to support your answer to your question.


In addition, review the provided rubric/scoring guidelines so that you understand what you will be expected to explain once you are done completing your program.  You will be required to do a presentation based on your group's program.  You should include a brainstorming section, a milestone chart, a discussion of your data source and format, and how you accessed the data, and code samples from the completed program.
